## adding more properties to the slides.

1. - creating props 
        - title(for slides)
        - timer(will show the countdown in the slides only if given true)

2.  - In the actual website, there is an adevertisement joined with the first slide component.  
    - Thus, we created a new file MidSlide.jsx in 'Home/' which would handle both slide and ad image.

3. - Again, in the actual flipkart website, there are advertisement banners in the middle of random slides in the home page.
    - so, we create a new file 'MidSection.jsx' which would contain a banner
    - imported url of three images from 'https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1mDT-2OQHusQrIt3VoECEAdoDu6y6W_N1'
    - used it in the banner and imported it in Home.jsx
    - declared it below Midslide component.
