## Creating slides in home page

1. - Created a new file slide.jsx 
   - imported carousel
   - added components, styled them

2.  - installed react-countdown
        - npm i react-countdown
    - imported countdown in src/Home/slide.jsx
        - import countdown from 'react-countdown';
    - formatted the countdown in the desired format in the function 'renderer'
    - added view All button

3. - imported Divider from mui-materials
   - Divider creates a line between two components. like a page breaker

4.  - added some more css and there we get the first slide of the flipkart clone.

5. - In 'src/Home/Home.jsx' add as many slides as you want and it would be replicated on the website.
